This game is about an Alien, which is the player, versus zombie(s) in a board that consists of random objects. Players are able to customise their desired number of rows, columns and zombies before starting the game. The Alien has a life set as 100 and attack as 0 in the beginning of the game, whereas the zombie(s) have randomly generated life, attack abnd range. In order to win this game, the player has to attack the zombie(s) till the zombie(s)'s life is 0. If the Alien's life is 0, the player lost.
